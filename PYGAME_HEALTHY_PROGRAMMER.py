'''Assume that a programmer works at the office from 9-5 pm. We have to take care of his health and remind him three things:

-To drink a total of 3.5-liter water after some time interval between 9-5 pm.
-To do eye exercise after every 30 minutes.
-To perform physical activity after every 45 minutes.
*Instructions:-
The task is to create a program that plays mp3 audio until the programmer enters the input which implies that he has done the task.

-For Water, the user should enter “Drank”
-For Eye Exercise, the user should enter “EyDone”
-For Physical Exercise, the user should enter “ExDone”
After the user entered the input, a file should be created for every task separately, which contains the details about the time when the user performed a certain task
