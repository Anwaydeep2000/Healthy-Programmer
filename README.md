# Health maintenance alarm for Healthy-Programmer
The task is to create a Pygame program that plays mp3 audio until the programmer enters the input which implies that he has done the task. The system is built to take care of health and remind three things:
 -To drink a glass of water after every 40 minutes interval between 9-5 pm.
 -To do eye exercise after every 30 minutes. 
 -To perform physical activity after every 45 minutes.
After the user entered the input, a file is created which contains the details about the time when the user performed a certain task.
